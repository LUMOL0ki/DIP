# Image Analysis I - VSB

### We have a few tasks to implement in this course:

- Implement a simple object classifier,
- implement a backpropagation neural network classifier,
- use a deep learning framework to implement a backpropagation neural network classifier,
- compute a well know object features that can be used in a classifier.
